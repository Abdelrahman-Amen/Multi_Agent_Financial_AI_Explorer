Agentic AI represents the next leap in artificial intelligence! Imagine systems that don’t just passively analyze data but **actively engage with tasks**, leveraging specialized tools and reasoning to achieve specific goals autonomously.  
An **agent** in this context is:  
- A **self-contained unit** of intelligence.  
- **Purpose-driven**, designed for a specific role or task.  
- Equipped with **tools**, access to **APIs**, and backed by **powerful AI models** to make decisions and execute actions.  

In short, **Agentic AI** brings us closer to creating systems that feel more like problem-solving companions than static programs.

## 🤖 **Agents in This Project**  

Let me walk you through the **two key agents** that form the backbone of this project:  

### 🌍 **Internet Search Specialist**  
This agent is your ultimate web search partner!  
- **Purpose**: Find and summarize online information with precision.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Leverages **DuckDuckGo** tools for intelligent web search.  
  - Ensures every response comes with **source citations**, so you always know where the information is from.  
  - Can remember the context of up to **5 past interactions**, making it feel natural and continuous in conversations.

Money talks, and so does this agent!  
- **Purpose**: Provide insights into stocks, company fundamentals, and financial trends.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Uses **Yahoo Finance Tools** to fetch real-time stock prices, analyst recommendations, and detailed financial metrics.

## 🚀 **The Playground**  

The **Playground** is where all the magic happens. 🎩✨  

Think of it as the **control center** where users can interact with:  
- The **Internet Search Specialist** for all things web.  
- The **Finance Agent** for market and business insights.  

### Why is the Playground Cool? 😎  
- It uses **Agno APIs** to power everything under the hood.  
- It’s designed to showcase **transparency** by showing tool calls in real time.  
- The entire system is modular—making it easy to extend or integrate with new tools and models.

## 🔑 **How It Works**  

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of the system:  

1. **API Keys**:  
   - The project uses environment variables (`GROQ_API_KEY` and `AGNO_API_KEY`) for authentication, ensuring your keys stay secure.  

2. **Agents**:  
   - Each agent is defined with a specific role, equipped with tools, and designed to perform tasks efficiently.  

3. **Combined Agent Team**:  
   - A super-agent that combines the capabilities of both the Internet Search Specialist and the Finance Agent to handle more complex requests.  

4. **Playground App**:  
   - interactive GUI-based Playground App powered by the Agno framework.
